## Project Notes

This project was intentionally kept within the initial setup of the take-home exercise.

- **React 16** was used instead of upgrading to React 18. This decision was made to ensure full compatibility with the version expected by the exercise instructions and avoid introducing issues or complexities unrelated to the task.
- Similarly, **TypeScript was not introduced** to keep the code aligned with the original project setup, which was JavaScript-based.
- I would like to note I have experience both with **React 18** as well as **TypeScript** if needed.
